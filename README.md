# Modernizing-Webpage-with-Semantic-HTML

Semtantic HTML replaces div elements to modernize the webpage.

## Description

This project changed the website's HTML from the use of div elements to Semantic HTML to modernize the HTML for easier coding and better user access. Semantic HTML provides a more standardized and accesible structure for the webpage. In this case, the user wanted a codebase that followed accessibility standards so that the site would be optimized for search engines, which was met by replacing divs with semantic HTML. Div elements are relatively generic, while semantic elements better describe the purpose of each element, making it more structered and simpler to navigate within the HTML code.
